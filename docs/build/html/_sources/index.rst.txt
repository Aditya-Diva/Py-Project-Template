Welcome to Py-Project-Template's documentation!
===================================================

This is a sample template for python projects that i'd like to update from time to time as i learn more in the python development space.

It's also meant to act as a refresher for some good practices and/or to look up basic how-to.

It involves some concepts like pydoc, abstract classes and implements a rather limited calculator logic as a base.
